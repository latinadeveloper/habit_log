# Specifications for the Sinatra Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Use Sinatra to build the app
- [x] Use ActiveRecord for storing information in a database - Forms are used
- [x] Include more than one model class (list of model class names e.g. User, Post, Category)- User, Habits, ActivityLog
- [x] Include at least one has_many relationship (x has_many y e.g. User has_many Posts) User has many habits
- [x] Include user accounts - users are created
- [x] Ensure that users can't modify content created by other users - a user must have a log in and password
- [x] Include user input validations - flash messages show up in forms
- [x] Display validation failures to user with error message (example form URL e.g. /posts/new) - messages are shown to user in red
- [x] Your README.md includes a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code

Confirm
- [x] You have a large number of small Git commits - up until now I have 34 commits
- [x] Your commit messages are meaningful - at times
- [x] You made the changes in a commit that relate to the commit message - maybe more detail in some of the commits is needed
- [x] You don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message - some commits have multiple file changes, others are just commits because I was trying to stick to the 10 minutes and/or 15 lines of code. At times I kept getting something to work and more time elapsed.
